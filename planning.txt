----- CP = "Computer Player" -----
----- HP = "Human Player" --------

-----------------------

- 52 cards
- 2-player "guessing" game
- each player gets 7 cards
- randomly pick who goes first
- take turns (of course)
- players can only ask for cards they have in their hand
- goal is to create more sets of 4 than the other player (does not support sets of 2)

- if (at the start or end of their turn) player has no cards in their hand but cards remain in the deck, draws a card.
- if either player has no cards in their hand and no cards remain in the deck, all sets should be had. game over.

STRUCTURES:
-----------------------
- list stores last 10 asks by HP
- dictionary stores last 10 asks by CP => result (FALSE if HP didn't have it, TRUE if they did)
- list stores HP sets 
- list stores CP sets
- list of probabilities (goes out to 10) for CP "remembering" cards
- list of cards represents the deck
- each card is its own object
  - has "name", "type", and "value" properties
    - For example, Ace of Spades would be... name: "Ace of Spades", type: "Spades", value: "Ace"

HOW CP MAKES GUESSES:
-----------------------
- CP checks whether any of their cards exist in the list of HP guesses.
  - if they do, takes the most recent one (lower index) (if multiple) and tries to "remember" it.
    - if CP "remembers" it, checks whether it is a card CP already asked for and received
      - if it is, CP tries to "remember" this as well
        - if succeeds, tries a different card (if there is one, otherwise randomly selects a card in the current hand to ask for)
        - if fails, tries to request it
    - if CP fails to "remember" or none of their cards are in the list of HP guesses, randomly selects a card in the current hand to ask for.

- the further down the line of HP's past guesses a card is, the CP is (exponentially) less likely to remember it.
  - ie. most recent guess? 100%; second to last guess? 50% chance; guess before that? 25% chance; etc.


DISPLAY EACH TURN:
-----------------------
CP Sets:
- (lists out sets)

CP Card Quantity (not the actual cards, of course)
- (lists out number of cards in CP's hand)

HP Sets:
- (lists out sets)

HP Cards:
- (lists out current hand of cards)
