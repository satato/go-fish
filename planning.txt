- 52 cards
- 2-player "guessing" game
- each player gets 7 cards
- randomly pick who goes first
- draw pile loses cards throughout play
- take turns (ofc)
- players can only ask for cards they have in their hand
- goal is to create more sets of 4 than the other player
- try to do some sort of text visual to illustrate the game? maybe? (possibly with a matrix to form a grid that can be printed out to the player so that each item within the matrix is easily editable ?)
- CP = Computer Player
- HP = Human Player (the user)
- each player draws a card at the beginning of their turn

HOW CP MAKES GUESSES:
- game tracks all of HP's guesses
- if CP's drawn card = HP's last guess: ask for card
- the further down the line of HP's past guesses a card is, the CP is (exponentially) less likely to remember it (define probabilities and probably use math.random() for this)
- ie. most recent guess? 100%; second to last guess? 50% chance; guess before that? 25% chance; etc.
